Overview
Welcome to the Smart Door project repository! Here, we detail the extensive tests and simulations our team conducted to create a cutting-edge door access control system. Leveraging Arduino, Internet of Things (IoT), and OpenCV technologies, our aim was to develop a seamless and secure entry control solution for homes and offices.

Key Features
Intuitive mobile application for remote door operation
Utilization of Arduino, IoT, and OpenCV for robust communication
Two-factor authentication system ensuring maximum security
AI-based face recognition for authorized individuals
Convenient push-button for easy exit from the space
Tests and Simulations
WiFi Card NODEMCU Integration
The foundation of our Smart Door system relied on seamless communication between the smart door and the mobile application. To achieve this, we conducted rigorous tests with the WiFi card NODEMCU. We verified its compatibility with the Arduino platform and its ability to connect to the Internet of Things (IoT) network securely. Through these tests, we ensured a reliable and efficient connection, allowing users to operate their doors remotely with ease.

Motion Detection and Sensor Integration
Security is paramount in any access control system. Hence, we integrated motion sensors into our Smart Door setup to detect any unauthorized access attempts. We meticulously simulated various scenarios to fine-tune the sensor's sensitivity, ensuring it accurately detects motion without triggering false alarms. The successful implementation of motion detection further fortified the system's security, providing peace of mind to users.

LED Indicators for User Feedback
User experience played a central role in the Smart Door project. To enhance user interaction, we incorporated LED indicators into the system. During testing, we carefully calibrated the LEDs to provide clear and intuitive feedback on the door's status, whether it's locked, unlocked, or in two-factor authentication mode. This feature added a touch of elegance to the system and kept users informed at a glance.
